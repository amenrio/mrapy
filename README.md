# My thesis

## TODO

- [ ] Decide on what to do and stick to it
- [ ] Ask Jhonie again for guidance
- [ ] Talk to your damn tutors

## Random Ideas
* Python, quirks and best practices: A perspective through the vfx and animation industry.
  * Python in the industry
    * What is a `pipeline`
    * DCCs
    * Code as a pipeline developer
      * Modularity and reusable pattern designs
      * Readability
      * Complexity

## Core concepts:

### What do I want to do

* Reduce the knowledge gap in pipeline / tools between professional studios and education centers
* Oriented for education
  * ? but how big? `randomb tools` big or `functional pipeline` big?
* I'm stuck with no promissing ideas and no real pressure to continue



### Want/Nice to have
- Easy to distribute, (PyPi, Docker, some technology I want to get better at...).
- Create something flexible and try not to hard-lock something into working only one way.
