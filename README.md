# My thesis

## TODO

- [ ] Decide on what to do and stick to it
- [ ] Ask Jhonie again for guidance
- [ ] Talk to your damn tutors

## Core concepts:

### What do I want to do

* Reduce the knowledge gap in pipeline / tools between professional studios and education centers
* Pyblish-like stuff
  * ? Jhonie doesn't like pyblish
* System oriented for education
  * ? but how big? `randomb tools` big or `functional pipeline` big?
* I'm stuck with no promissing ideas and no real pressure to continue



### Want/Nice to have
- Easy to distribute, (PyPi, Docker, some technology I want to get better at...).
- Create something flexible and try not to hard-lock something into working only one way.
